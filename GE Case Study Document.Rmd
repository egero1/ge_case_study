## Introduction and Problem Statement

Pneumoconiosis, also known as "black lung disease", is an occupational lung disease caused by dusts that are breathed in and then deposited deep in the lungs causing damage (American Lung Association, 2018). It is often found in employees working in the mining or agricultural industries. There is no cure for Pneumoconiosis, so early detection is vital for proper treatment. 

Traditionally, Pneumoconiosis is detected by having trained medical personnel review chest x-rays for abnormalities. However, due to the lack of trained doctors and the large number of patients waiting to be screened, a reliable and automated process for early detection has been requested.

 __Figure 1__ provides an example image of a patient with signs of Pneumoconiosis. An algorithm has been developed to identify the abnormalities in the lungs that are visible in the x-ray images and the data has been collected. 

```{r image, out.width = '250px', fig.cap = 'Signs of pneumoconiosis', fig.align = "center", fig.pos = 'H'}

include_graphics("Photos/1730153-1-eng-GB_2lung-800x560.jpg")

```

## Data

The data consists of 2,606 observations from `r length(unique(full$PatientNumMasked))` patients and is split between six lung segments. The six segments represent the right upper, right middle, right lower, left upper, left middle, and left lower regions of the lung images. 

Each segment contains 39 continuous variables and one categorical variable as the response. 



## Exploratory Data Analysis

Note in __Table 1__ that the count of observations by segment differs. This indicates that not all of the `r length(unique(full$PatientNumMasked))` unique patients have observations for all lung segments. 

```{r data, echo = FALSE}

observations <- use_data %>% 
        group_by(Position) %>%
        summarize(Count = n())
observations$Position <- as.character(observations$Position)
observations <- rbind(observations, c('Total', sum(observations$Count)))
kable(observations, caption = "Lung Segment Observations", booktabs = TRUE) %>% 
        kable_styling(font_size = 8, position = 'float_right', latex_options = c("striped"))

```

## Naive Model and Variable Importance
Ok, now we talk about naive model and what we are looking at. 

```{r naive_model, echo = FALSE, comment = NA}

tree <- rpart(Label2 ~., data = use_data)
rpart.plot(tree)

```

The model... I dont understand why it moves the image  

```{r naive_cm, echo = FALSE, , comment = NA}

tree.pred <- predict(tree, use_data, type = 'class')
tree.cm <- confusionMatrix(tree.pred, use_data$Label2, positive = 'Normal')

kable(tree.cm$table, caption = "Confusion Matrix", booktabs = TRUE) %>% 
        kable_styling(font_size = 8, position = 'float_right', latex_options = c("striped", "hold_position"))

kable(tree.cm$overall, booktabs = TRUE, col.names = 'Value') %>% 
        kable_styling(font_size = 8, position = 'float_right', latex_options = c("striped", "hold_position"))

kable(as.data.frame(tree.cm$byClass), booktabs = TRUE, col.names = 'Value') %>% 
        kable_styling(font_size = 8, position = 'float_right', latex_options = c("striped", "hold_position"))

```

```{r summaries, echo = FALSE, comment = NA}

stats <- basicStats(use_data[-c(40,41)])[c('Mean', 'Median', 'Stdev', 'Minimum', 'Maximum', 'NAs'),]

You can also embed plots, for example:


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
